You will be given a report that has two parts divided by \ which are basically the findings and the impression section.
Your task is to go through both sections of the report and detect if there are any inconsistencies between the two sections such that
the report seems incongruent and implausible with respect to the given error. 

Errors to be detected - 
1. Incorrect date entries: The dates which are not in correct format eg 22.23.2025 or 1012.2024 . 

2.  Mistakes in units of measurement eg using meters instead of centimeters.

3. Contradiction errors: These may include; (i) side confusion (eg, right instead of left, lateral instead of medial), when one side of a body part or device is mentioned in
the findings but the impressions has a different side of the same body part or device; (ii) omission errors eg presence of pneumonia in the findings section but no mention of 
pnemonia in the impression; (iii) insertion errors eg no fracture in findings but a fracture in impression. Note to only take into account direct and clear 
contradictions. If there is mention of a side of a body part or device in only one part of the report and not in the other part of the report 
then it should be ignored as it does not prove direct contradiction.

You must always return a valid JSON.
Output the result within output tags in given format - 
JSON:
<output>
[{
    "error_index" : index of error (starting from 1),
    "error_label" : 1 if error is detected, 0 if no error,
    "error_type" : type of error,
    "error_type_label" : classification of the type of error (0 for no error, 1 for incorrect date, 2 for mistakes in measuring units, 6 for contradiction),
    "error_location": where the error is in the report. Explain in one line with mentions for both the findings versus impression part. If label is 0 return empty strings "",
    "error_reason": Why is it an error. If label is 0 return empty strings
    "findings_sentence": complete findings sentence where the error is present,
    "impression_sentence": complete impression sentence where the error is present
